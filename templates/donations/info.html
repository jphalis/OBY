            Our goal is to help. We want to make people happy, and provide opportunities for success. Whether itâ€™s to further your education, pay for medical bills, aid in charitable fundraising, hosting events to raise awareness for a cause, etc., we are here.
            <br/><br/>
            There are ample causes to donate to, so let us help you find the right one. We provide an opportunity for success, not a direct path. Recipients will have to work hard, but we want to provide the tools to reach that goal.
            <br/><br/>
            90% of all donations are put directly towards good causes. The outstanding 10% is used to make sure transactions are secure, and that the most beneficial causes are chosen. We are not yet registered as a 501(c) organization, but it is something we are pursuing.
            <br/><br/>
