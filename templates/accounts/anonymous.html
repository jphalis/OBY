            <p>Woman: Is there a problem, Officer?<br/><br/>
            Officer: Ma'am, you were speeding.<br/><br/>
            Woman: Oh, I see.<br/><br/>
            Officer: Can I see your license please?<br/><br/>
            Woman: I'd give it to you but I don't have one.<br/><br/>
            Officer: Don't have one?<br/><br/>
            Woman: Lost it 4 times for drunk driving.<br/><br/>
            Officer: I see...Can I see your vehicle registration papers please.<br/><br/>
            Woman: I can't do that.<br/><br/>
            Officer: Why not?<br/><br/>
            Woman: I stole this car.<br/><br/>
            Officer: Stole it?<br/><br/>
            Woman: Yes, and I killed and hacked up the owner.<br/><br/>
            Officer: You what?<br/><br/>
            Woman: His body parts are in plastic bags in the trunk if you want to see.<br/><br/>
            The Officer looks at the woman, slowly backs away to his car, and calls for back up. Within minutes 5 police cars circle the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.<br/><br/>
            Officer 2: Ma'am, could you step out of your vehicle please!<br/><br/>
            The woman steps out of her vehicle.<br/><br/>
            Woman: Is there a problem sir?<br/><br/>
            Officer 2: One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.<br/><br/>
            Woman: Murdered the owner?<br/><br/>
            Officer 2: Yes, could you please open the trunk of your car, please.<br/><br/>
            The woman opens the trunk, revealing nothing but an empty trunk.<br/><br/>
            Officer 2: Is this your car, ma'am?<br/><br/>
            Woman: Yes, here are the registration papers.<br/><br/>
            The first officer is stunned.<br/><br/>
            Officer 2: One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license.<br/><br/>
            The woman digs into her handbag and pulls out a clutch purse and hands it to the officer. The officer snaps open the clutch purse and examines the license. He looks quite puzzled.<br/><br/>
            Officer 2: Thank you ma'am, one of my officers told me you didn't have a license, that you stole this car, and that you murdered and hacked up the owner.<br/><br/>
            Woman: Betcha the lying bastard told you I was speeding too.</p>
